# Viper V765 RGB Software
UNOFFICIAL Software for changing RGB color of the Viper V765 keyboard. Works on Linux and should work on Windows too though I never tested it on there.
I only made it for ISO-DE layout but I am sure it works with other ISO layouts too. I don't know about ANSII, so you might have to figure it out with trial and error.
Can't guarantee functionality since my keyboard broke and I don't use the software myself anymore. But I hope it can come in handy for others.


I also tried to seperate the packet sending stuff in it's own file so if someone wants they can write there own software around it (i hope it is clear enough how to use it)

## Usage

## Motivation
When I switched to Linux, I suddenly couldn't change the color of my keyboard anymore, since the software is Windows only. I already didn't really like the official software. 
So I decided to frankenstein my own software for it. This was my first time working with Python and my first time reverse engineering anything, so the code might suck a lot.
But it worked well for me.
